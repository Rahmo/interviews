# interviews
my interview prep and experiences
look into my experience:
1. maintain running median of incoming numbers
2. maintain running avg of incoming numbers 
3. binary tree and BST are favorites to all interviewers
4. common ancestor in BST without info about root
5. find word in a matrix, each char of word should be one step (up/down/left/right) away from next
